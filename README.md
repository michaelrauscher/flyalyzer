# Flyalyzer

Flyalyzer is a self-contained MATLAB program for kinematic analysis of insects in tethered flight. It requires the image processing toolbox. As the program is presently in a "working beta" stage, UI features and behaviors may still change appreciably between commits. An example video of a tethered fruit fly responding to a periodic yaw visual stimulus is included in the repository for demonstration and testing purposes.
