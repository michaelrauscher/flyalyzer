# Flyalyzer

Flyalyzer is a self-contained MATLAB program for kinematic analysis of fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*) in tethered flight, although it should be useable for video analysis of other insects as well. It requires the image processing and statistics toolboxes. An example video of a tethered fruit fly responding to a periodic yaw visual stimulus is included in the repository for demonstration and testing purposes.
