# Flyalyzer

Flyalyzer is a self-contained MATLAB program for kinematic analysis of insects in tethered flight. It requires the image processing toolbox. An example video of a tethered fruit fly responding to a periodic yaw visual stimulus is included in the repository. The program is presently in a "working beta" stage and features and UI behaviors may change considerably between commits
